**EDA on Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset**

The task in this repository is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Haberman's Cancer Survival Dataset. The goal is to gain insights into the dataset and understand the survival rate of patients who have undergone surgery for breast cancer, specifically focusing on patients with positive Axillary lymph nodes.

**Dataset Information:**

- Title: Haberman's Survival Data
- Sources:
  - Donor: Tjen-Sien Lim (limt@stat.wisc.edu)
  - Date: March 4, 1999

**Relevant Information:**

The dataset consists of cases from a study conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital. The study aimed to analyze the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

**Dataset Details:**

- Number of Instances: 306
- Number of Attributes: 4 (including the class attribute)

**Attribute Information:**

1. Age of patient at the time of the operation (numerical)
2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4. Survival status (class attribute):
   - 1 = The patient survived 5 years or longer
   - 2 = The patient died within 5 years

Performing EDA on this dataset will provide us with valuable insights into a patient's 5-year survival rate after being diagnosed with breast cancer and having positive axillary lymph nodes. By exploring the data, we can gain a better understanding of the factors that may influence survival outcomes in such cases.
